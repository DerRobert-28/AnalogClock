# AnalogClock

* [For feedback and support, feel free to contact me](https://www.youtube.com/@DerRobert28/community).

<br>

## Features:

- This resource pack contains a 32x32 analogue clock.

- It should be compatible to the most Minecraft versions.

- Compatibility ends in Minecraft JE versions without clock.

<br>

## Windows installation using `git`:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/AnalogClock.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation using `git`:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/AnalogClock.git
```

<br>

## Alternative installation:

- [Download the ZIP file of the master branch to your PC](https://github.com/DerRobert-28/AnalogClock/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

- Copy the folder inside the ZIP file into your `resourcepacks` folder:

  - for Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks`

  - for Linux: `~\.minecraft\resourcepacks`

- **IMPORTANT:**

  - If you just copy the ZIP file itself into your `resourcepacks` folder, it will **NOT** work.
  
  - If you extract all files and copy the extracted `resourcepacks` folder, it may also **NOT** work.

<br>

## Please note:

- If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.
